Frequent Reviews & Adjustments – Regularly review budgets, adjust plans, and ensure spending aligns with project goals.

3.   Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Answer:
Agile is flexible, iterative, and emphasizes collaboration. It delivers work in small increments, allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation. Testing happens alongside development, and customer involvement is ongoing. Agile is great for projects with evolving requirements but can be unpredictable in scope and timeline.

Waterfall follows a structured, sequential approach, where each phase (planning, design, development, testing, deployment) is completed before moving to the next. It works well for projects with clear, fixed requirements but is rigid and slow to adapt to change. Testing happens late, which can lead to costly revisions.

Advantages and disadvantages
Agile Methodology
Advantages:
Faster delivery of working software (continuous releases). Adaptability to changing requirements. Close collaboration between stakeholders and developers. Early detection and resolution of issues through continuous testing.

Disadvantages:
Requires high customer involvement, which may not always be feasible. Less predictability in scope, timeline, and budget. Documentation may be insufficient due to focus on working software. Can be challenging for large, complex projects with strict regulations.

Waterfall Methodology
Advantages:
Clear structure with well-defined milestones. Works well for projects with fixed requirements and no expected changes. Easier to manage progress with detailed documentation. Suitable for projects where regulatory compliance is important.

Disadvantages:
Difficult to accommodate changes once development has started. Late-stage testing increases the risk of identifying critical issues too late.Long delivery cycles may lead to outdated solutions by the time of release. Less stakeholder feedback, which can result in misaligned expectations.


4.  In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Answer:
Agile is best for projects with evolving needs and fast iterations, like software development, startups, and game design. It thrives on flexibility and continuous feedback.

Waterfall suits projects with fixed requirements and strict processes, such as construction, manufacturing, and regulated industries. It ensures predictability and thorough planning.

5.  What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Answer:
Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance
Automated Testing – Use unit, integration, and regression tests to catch issues early.
Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD) – Automate code integration and testing for faster, safer releases.
Code Reviews & Pair Programming – Peer reviews help detect errors and improve code quality.
Static Code Analysis – Tools like SonarQube identify vulnerabilities and inefficiencies.
Test-Driven Development (TDD) – Write tests before code to ensure functionality meets requirements.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT) – Validate with real users to ensure the software meets expectations.
Performance & Security Testing – Identify bottlenecks and vulnerabilities before release.
Clear Documentation & Standards – Maintain coding guidelines and best practices.
Why High Standards Matter
Reliability & Stability – Reduces bugs and failures in production.
Security – Prevents vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches.
User Satisfaction – Ensures a smooth experience, improving adoption and retention.
Cost Savings – Fixing issues early is cheaper than post-release fixes.
Regulatory Compliance – Necessary in industries like finance and healthcare.


6.  How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Answer:
How Defining Project Scope Contributes to Success
Defining the project scope sets clear boundaries on deliverables, timelines, and objectives. It helps:

Prevent Scope Creep – Avoids uncontrolled changes that derail timelines and budgets.
